# Smart Attendance System

## Overview

The **Smart Attendance System** is a vision-based project that automates attendance tracking using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It leverages face recognition or other vision-based methods to register attendance in real-time, making the traditional manual system more efficient and accurate.

## Features

- Real-time attendance tracking
- Face recognition for identifying students/employees
- Automatic recording of attendance in a database or file
- Simple and intuitive interface

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Face Recognition (if applicable)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (if machine learning is involved)
- SQLite/MySQL (or any database you use)
- Flask (if you have a web interface)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Utkgitdev-07/Smart-Attendance-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Smart-Attendance-System
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

### Commands

You can follow the commands listed in `commands.txt` for executing various components of the project. Here are some common examples:

1. **Start the Attendance System**:
   Run the system by executing the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Face Recognition Setup** (if applicable):
   If you need to train or set up the face recognition model, use:
   ```bash
   python utils/face_recognition.py
   ```

3. **Database Operations** (if applicable):
   To initialize or interact with the database, use the utility script:
   ```bash
   python utils/database.py
   ```

Refer to `commands.txt` for more detailed commands and scripts that you can use.

## File Details

### `main.py`
This is the main script to run the attendance system. It starts the webcam feed, detects faces, and logs attendance based on recognized faces.

### `requirements.txt`
Contains the list of dependencies required to run the project. You can install them using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `commands.txt`
This file contains various commands to run different components of the system, including starting the system, training face recognition models, and interacting with the database.

### `attendance_logs/`
Contains files related to attendance logging.

- **attendance.csv**: Stores the attendance records, including timestamps and recognized faces.

### `models/`
This folder contains any pre-trained models used for face recognition or other tasks.

- **model.pkl**: A placeholder file for the machine learning model used for attendance recognition (if applicable).

### `utils/`
This folder contains utility functions for the system's operation.

- **face_recognition.py**: Implements the logic for detecting and recognizing faces using OpenCV and face recognition techniques.
- **database.py**: Contains database-related functions, such as adding records or querying attendance data.
